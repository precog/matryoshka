- add type aliases for various types (like `Free` and `Cofree`) in a new package to show the equivalences, and start moving toward fixed-point alternatives
- add `AlgebraIso` to make isomorphic algebras explicit.
- a few new pattern functors (in their own package) â€“ `CoEnv`, `ListF`, `Diff`, and `PotentialFailure`.
